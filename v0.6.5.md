# Changelog - v0.6.5

## Improvements/New Features

### Nullable Report Parameters

Added in some new logic to handle report parameters which the server will accept as being null. This now pulls in the nullable type and will display a checkbox
for null within the input group for the user to select. If the parameter is nullable and of type DateTime, the input field will have both the null checkbox
as well as the custom date time button.

### Update to Edit Page

Updated the edit page to allow for saving the schedule from any tab, rather than just on the recurrence tab. Having the user only be able to save on the recurrence
tab was initially implemented for the create page, since it requires all fields to be filled, it made the most sense to wait until the user steps through each tab
before allowing them to save. However, when working with the edit page, it makes the most sense to allow the user to save the schedule from any tab. This way if
the user just needs to update the contacts on the schedule, they can add/remove contacts and save from that tab without having to go to the recurrence to save. Just
a small quality of life improvement to make the process of scheduling more intuitive and smoother.
