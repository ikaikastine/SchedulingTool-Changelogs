## Bug Fixes

* Fixed issue where dependency text was being added twice in IE
* Fixed issue where custom date params that were a dependency for other parameters would cause an error
  * Fixed this by calculating the date with moment.js and passing that to the report server then replacing the calculated date with the formatted date text
* Fixed issue where copying/pasting a custom datetime parameter would not be recognized as a custom datetime
* Changed the CSS for the report parameters table to include a scrollbar if the text overflows the width of the column
