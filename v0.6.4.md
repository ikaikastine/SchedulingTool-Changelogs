## Improvements/New Features

### Custom Date Parameters Improvements

Made a few changes to the way custom date parameters are handled. Added in logic to handle an additional use case where a custom date parameter is
used as a dependency for another parameter. When this is the case, the report server won't accept the formatted date string, only a valid datetime.
To fix this I've implemented a function that converts the formatted date string into an actual date, and stores the date to be passed back to the controller.
On the controller end, we pass in the calculated date to the report server to pull in the dependent parameters and switch the value back to the formatted string
after getting the dependent parameters. Also implemented some more logic to handle when a user copies and pastes a custom date into a date field to recognize that
as a customDateTime.

* Fixed issue where custom date params that were a dependency for other parameters would cause an error
* Fixed issue where copying/pasting a custom datetime parameter would not be recognized as a custom datetime

### Table Scrollbar

Added a new feature to the report table which shows a scrollbar on the parameter when the length of the text is longer than the width of it's containing column.
Rather than having the value be cut off and hidden behind the next column, the scroll bar will allow the scheduler to look at the full string of the parameter name
or parameter value.

### Reduced Steps to Edit Schedule

Removed the link to details from the schedules table in favor of going directly to edit. This helps reduce the number of steps requried to edit the schedule. Instead
of navigating to Schedules -> Edit Button -> Details Page -> Edit Page, the user can now go to Schedules -> Edit Button -> Edit Page. While this removes the ability
to just view what is stored in that particular schedule, it reduces the number of steps. This can be easily reverted in the future.

### Boolean Handling

Added in some logic to handle any boolean type parameters that get passed in from the report server. Since the server only reports a single string on this,
I've added in the ability to check the default of that string and match it to true/false. I've also included a dropdown menu for boolean type parameters
so the user can select either true or false and save that parameter.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed issue where dependency text was being added twice in IE
  * Fixed this by calculating the date with moment.js and passing that to the report server then replacing the calculated date with the formatted date text
* Changed the CSS for the report parameters table to include a scrollbar if the text overflows the width of the column
