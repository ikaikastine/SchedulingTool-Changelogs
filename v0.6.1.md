# Changelog - v0.6.1

## Improvements/New Features

### Schedule Name

Added in some JavaScript to add the Schedule Name to the header on the create schedule page. This helps the user know what the schedule is when they
go to subsequent tabs. Once the user adds a schedule name while creating a schedule and unfocuses on the input box, the schedule name will be added
to the *Create Schedule* header.

### Contact Focus

Added some functionality to auto focus on the contact input field when the *Add +* button is clicked and the contact modal is opened.

### Report Parameter SoapException Error Handling

Added some error handling for SoapExceptions thrown when trying to pull in dependent report parameters. Instead of just doing nothing, the user will have
the alert modal displayed so they know an error occured, and can determinei what failed.

### Edit Report Parameters

Implemented the ability to edit report parameters when going to edit a schedule. Currently this only works when you go to schedule details -> edit -> reports and click edit.
This allows the user to pull in whatever values are stored in the database, and update those entries. This works by pulling in the parameters from an ajax call, then putting up
the modal with the parameter values displayed just as adding parameters to a new report would be shown. This allowed for the reuse of a lot of code which makes things much simpler.
In order to display everything like it would for new report, we needed to make a call back to the controller and hit the report server to make sure we're pulling in all available
parameter values.

### Current Option for Custom Date Parameters

Added in a 'Current' option for custom date time parameters to handle certain cases such as wanting the StartDate to be the 5th of the Current Month. Using current will disable the
the input field for CountOfTimeSpan since it is irrelevant while using the current option.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed issue that prevented error handling from working on dependency parameters that was not an input field (i.e. dropdown, select list, etc.)
* Fixed issue that caused a modal to lose it's scrollbar when a second modal was dismissed
* Fixed bug that caused the datepicker for DateTime parameters to be appear behind the modal
* Fixed issue that caused the clearfix counter to be offset due to it checking the defaultValue instead of defaultHidden
