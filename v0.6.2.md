# Changelog - v0.6.2

2018-05-18 Kevin Stine <kevin.stine@pacificsource.com>

## Improvements/New Features

### Upgrade to Bootstrap v4

Upgraded from Bootstrap v3.3.7 -> v4.1 which gives everything a much cleaner overall look. This required some changes to the way that things were formatted,
but overall makes for a better User Experience. In addition, v4 relies on flexbox which makes the layout of objects such as the dynamic report parameters much easier.
Also wanted to upgrade to v4 to get the project on the latest version of the Bootstrap framework to help futurize things moving forward.

### Edit Report Parameters Revamp

Reworked the way that the tool would edit report parameters. Previously, the tool would only be able to handle editing report parameters which were *already* stored in the
database. This made the functionality of editing parameters extremely limited as you could not edit new reports you add to a schedule, and would need to save a schedule
*before* you were able to edit the parameters. This feature was re-imagined from the ground up to utilize client-side logic over server-side. This allows the user to
edit report parameters of reports that have been saved in the database *and* new reports that are added.

### Custom Date Options Visual

Added a new section under the custom date parameters that displays to the user the calculated date representation of what they user is inputting into the fields.
This should help to verify that the user is putting in the correct values and getting what they expect.
